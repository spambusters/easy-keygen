# easy-keygen
Proof of concept keygen for a fictional, simple algorithm

## About
By reading the disassembly of a program, we discover that a fictional company uses a very simple alogrithm for its licensing keys.  

It adds each char's ASCII value until a sum of 808 is reached.  
In other words, any string whose ASCII values total 808 will be considered a valid key.  

## Usage  
When prompted, simply enter the number of keys you wish to produce   

## Output  
After discovering the appropriate amount of keys, each will be written to the keys.txt file
